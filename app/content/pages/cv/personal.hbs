          <h4>Design Approach</h4>
          <p>I loosely follow a priority-based approach in designing and developing applications. In general, User Experience is first priority, followed closely by Performance and Scalability. The rest are shuffled around variably to compensate for compromises in any of the first two priorities.</p>
          <p>In terms of tech stack, I am heavily invested in server-side JS, non-relational databases, lean front end tech, and AWS Cloud platform for staging and deployment.</p>

        <h4>Looking For Work</h4>
        <p>I am looking for work in either of the following fields.</p>
        <ul>

          <li><b>Technical Leadership and Development</b>, I have been succesful in this field during my corporate stint, and I am looking to further hone my skills here. If you are building an office, launching a new department, or have an existing team that needs technical guidance, we may be a good match.</li>

          <li><b>UI/UX Development and Design</b>, I am new to this but I have some work experience and it has always been a big interest of mine, I wish to explore this field further as well as someday find a place for myself in its community. I'm looking for someone who needs help in UI Engineering where I can be immediately applicable, as well as someone who is willing to teach or apprentice in terms of UX Design.</li>

          <li><b>Product Design &amp; Development</b>. I have an affinity for minimal specific solutions more than general swiss-army-knife solutions. I have an understanding of Software Development methods (including Lean), as well as fully capable in prototyping or engineering in any development facet. I value growth and scale as much as I value code. I am fine with fast iteration rounds, rapid protoyping, and validating ideas through testing or research. If this is you, we might make a good match.</li>

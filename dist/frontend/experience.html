          <h6>ATM Interface (E-Pass)</h6>
          <p>An in-person machine that takes cash and stores credit for prepaid highway toll fees. The interface runs on Webkit, the reason being the client wants to be able to update the system remotely without technicians on the field.</p>
          <p>There are about a handful of layouts, and the user interaction is simple (touch) because of the hardware limitations. I used <u>plain JavaScript</u> and <u>CSS animations</u> triggered by attributes. </p>

          <img src="http://placehold.it/970x200" alt="">

          <p><b>Status: Active</b>, servicing a percentage of 75k users. This interface is in place in all of the client's ATMs.</p>

          <h6>Quart</h6>
          <p>A hosted markdown blogging platform and web-based text editor.</p>
          <p>I used <u>Backbone Routers, Views, and Models</u> here. The text editor is a personally extended <u>Ace Editor</u>. The parts of speech highlighting and writing assistant is coded in by hand, tagging aided by a <a href="https://github.com/singingfish/jspos">POS library</a>. Templating is powered by <u>Underscore</u>.</p>
          <img src="http://placehold.it/970x200" alt="">
          <p><b>Status: Shelved</b>, the user base was small (80), and the cost to sustain was too much for a free app. I decided to make a similar service that was much more sustainable.</p>

          <h6>Lilii</h6>
          <p>A convention-based markdown blogging platform that is managed through Dropbox. Created as a more sustainable free service alternative to Quart, costing $0.18 per month at most on AWS.</p>
          <p>The blog layout uses <u>Angular</u> for pagination, <u>Hyphenator</u> for smart hyphenation, <u>Zepto</u> for block-level commenting, and <u>plain Javascript</u> for Typographic progressive enhancements.</p>

          <h6>Brook</h6>
          <p>Brook is a linkboard heavily inspired by Hacker News and the Subreditting format. This is a practice in code brevity.</p>
          <p>The platform is designed to respond to requests in under 500ms, as well as to scale fast on a single core. All modern solutions are dumped for <u>plain JavaScript</u> and <u>CSS</u>. It uses non-conventional solutions for communication to reduce code footprint.</p>
          <img src="http://placehold.it/970x200" alt="">
          <p><b>Status: Active</b>, this is an open source project, the codebase can be found <a href="https://github.com/hmngwy/brook">here</a>.</p>
